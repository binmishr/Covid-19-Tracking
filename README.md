A Brief Introduction
=======================

Get Your Epidemiology from Epidemiologists

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage. I’m strongly committed to what should be the uncontroversial view that we should listen to the recommendations of those institutions and individuals with strong expertise in the relevant fields of Public Health, Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Infection Modeling. I also think that the open availability of data, and the free availability of methods to look at data, is generally a good thing. The tricky part is when these potentially conflict. For example, in a period of crisis it is reasonable to want to find out what’s happening and to inform yourself as much as possible about how events are unfolding. People who work with data of some sort will naturally want to look at the available trends themselves. But maybe those same people don’t know a great deal about how disease works, or how information about it is collected and processed, or what is likely to happen in a situation like the one we’re experiencing. At such times, there’s a balance to be struck between using the available tools to come to an informed opinion and recklessly mucking about with data when you don’t really know what you’re doing. This is especially important when, as is the case now, the Executive response to the crisis in the United States (and in several other countries) has been criminally irresponsible, to the point where even elementary facts about the spread of the disease over the past few months are being distorted.

Speaking for myself, I definitely want look at what the trends are and I prefer to do so by working directly with the data that official agencies and reliable reporting produces. So in this post I’ll show how I’m doing that. But I definitely don’t want to publicly mess around beyond this. While I might idly fit some models or play with various extrapolations of the data, I’m very conscious that I am not in a position to do this in a professional capacity. So that part I will firmly set aside. There are already many well-qualified people working publicly to actually analyze and model the data, as opposed to looking descriptively at what is happening.

I’m going to show you how to get the data to draw this graph.
